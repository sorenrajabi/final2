            UPDATES
            1) This project was difficult at first because javascript was a new concept
                so learning how to create buttons and text fields was the first obstacle.
            2) Setting the names and values and knowing the differences and what they do
                took me a bit of time to understand
            3) I learned how to use the id in javascript to get value from the html doc
            4) Creating the drop down list for drink and size was one of my first obstacles,
                by using select and option I was able to create a drop down and assign values
            5) Using labels and inputs I was able to create text fields for customer inputs
            6) Similar to C# I created a click event that starts the whole process
            7) Within that click event I set my variables using "let" and "document.getElementById"
            8) Using those values I was able to create a layout of information for an order 
                in the display box
            9) I ran into trouble displaying the selected option in drop down list and text fields
            10) I was able to overcome this by adding ".value" at the end of the variable name
            11) Clearing the display box after every click and incrementing the customer number
            is the last thing I need to do to finish my project
            12) Will was able to help me clear display and show incrementing <br>


            DOCUMENTATION<br>
            - My project is a point of sale system for ordering a pizza
            - First I created a GUI first that started with a navigation bar at the top
            - I added an image of a pizza so you know you came to the right place and to
                appeal to the customer
            - Then I created 3 different containers from left to right
            - The left containing customer number, pizza size, and toppings
            - The middle shows the display
            - The right contains the drink, size, and customer information
            - At the very bottom is also 3 containers left to right with the button in
            the middle
            - I styled my page to match the colorway of the pizza image which is red and yellow
            - The last half of this project was creating the javascript to display the information
            in the display
            - That part is explained in the UPDATES above
